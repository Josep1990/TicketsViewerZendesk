Hi,

Hope you are all well.

My name is Jose Paulo.

This is my final project for the Zendesk Code Challenge.

This is a Command Line Interface Application.

To run the app just open the project folder on any java IDE.

Here is the link to the GitHub repo.

Google Drive:

To run the Application on Windows:
enter in the command line and type:
java -jar {Directory}\TicketViewr-v1.jar

or Double click in the runapp.bat on the zip folder.

For this challenge, I used only Java on Eclipse IDE and Junit 5 for testing, 
before this project, I had no experience setting up Unit tests, so the challenge also allowed me to go into testing.

Thank you for the opportunity. 

Best Wishes
Jose Paulo
